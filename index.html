        Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the
        moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings, birds, animals, etc. In
        nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy.
        For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another.
        Humans, for example, rely on nature for their survival, and nature
        provides us with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothing,
        among other things. Many shades may be seen in nature, contributing to
        the planet’s beauty. Along with humans, animals and birds also find
        their habitat and means of survival in nature. Therefore, it is
        essential to take proper care of our nature for maintaining a healthy
        life.

        A sun set scene is a delightful scene. The mellow sun going down over
        the western horizon looks like a golden disc. Trees and plants, crops
        and creepers– everything is lit up with a golden glow .the floating of
        fleecy clouds looks like a stretch of fire. The landscape presents a
        piece of enchanting beauty. As the sun reflects through the rivers,
        canals and ponds they seem to enshrine in their bosoms a golden ball
        with outstretched luster of liquid fire. All this constitutes a sight to
        see. Then gradually the sun sinks below across the hazy trees at the
        distant horizon. The night falls with appall of darkness. The majestic
        sun sets for the night and leaves the world under the reign of darkness
        to rule the roost.Sunset is the time when the sun goes down and night
        begins.
